  <p>       Pan-Dam was born in 2019, on the 22nd of October, in the cafè of the Kriterion Filmtheatre. A few weeks before I had decided to open my own publication, to break my inertia and finally get started on a project I had been fantasizing about for years. I spent sleepless nights posting and posting in a multitude of writing-related Facebook groups, texting and emailing hundreds of people, hoping to find someone willing to embark on this project with me.</p>
<p>       I received three answers and quickly hurried to schedule a first meeting. On that 22nd of October I met Chiara, Tiana and Fanny, and within a few hours Pan-Dam was born. Four strangers sitting at a coffee table, this is how it started. Pan-Dam: stories of Amsterdam, for Amsterdam. Our aim is to provide an analysis of Amsterdam’s urban dynamics -its strengths, weaknesses, uniquenesses, contours, people- through the stories of those who make Amsterdam what it is.</p>
<p>       We want to empower our readers to participate in an innovative, sustainable development of Amsterdam by providing them with a critical sketch of the city. Hence the name, ‘all’-Dam: <strong>involving all people, exposing all urban traits.</strong> What we have managed to achieve in the past three months wouldn’t have been possible without 31mag.nl: their support, mentorship and care.</p>
<p><strong>Stay tuned for an exciting six months of provocative articles, photography and an eye-opening podcast.</strong></p>
