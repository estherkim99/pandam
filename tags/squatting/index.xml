      <description>This article aims to portray OT301 as the space that it is today: a cultural hotspot in Amsterdam. Questioning its narrative as an autonomous space, we want to engage with OT301’s history and current state of affairs. We want to thank Ivo, one of the co-founders of Amsterdam Alternative and part of OT301’s team, for answering all of our questions and providing photographs.
Back in the 1980s, the squatting movement emerged in the Netherlands due to a lack of affordable housing.</description>
