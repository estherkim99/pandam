      <description>OT301 is a cultural hotspot in Amsterdam. Questioning its narrative as an autonomous space; we tried to engage with OT301’s history and the current state of affairs.
 Back in the ’80s, the lack of affordable housing helped the squatting movement to emerge in the Netherlands. ‘Squatting’ is what most would describe as occupying, living, in an abandoned building; not just out of necessity, but as a conscious political act.</description>

The coronavirus pandemic will bring an additional 130 million people to starvation, the UN warned in late April. Meanwhile, Europe and the United States are producing unprecedented amounts of food waste following the abrupt decline in demand from restaurants, catering services and school mensas. The message here is that the food system in the western world is ridiculously toxic and wasteful. While others starve, “over 1/3 of all food produced globally is thrown away and in countries like the US, 50% of the food produced is wasted,” explains Isabel Allen.</description>

Wikimedia&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Author: W &amp;nbsp; CC BY 2.0 Lindsay Eyink&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Licence&amp;nbsp; --  Who would ever expect to find an anarchist bookshop in Jodenbreestraat Street, one of the most touristic spots of the capital? And yet there stands Fort of Sjakoo, one of the eldest stores of its kind, packed with shelves full of anarchist, feminist and left-wing political publications; the thoughts of some of the most important thinkers of history lay in ancient books, waiting to be read.</description>

Tradotto dall’inglese
 Chi si aspetterebbe mai di trovare una libreria anarchica in Jodenbreestraat Street, uno dei luoghi più turistici della capitale? Eppure Fort of Sjakoo, uno dei negozi più grandi e longevi del suo genere, pieno di scaffali pieni di pubblicazioni politiche anarchiche, femministe e di sinistra è proprio lì.
 Per i dieci volontari che gestiscono la libreria è una missione quella di fornire un rifugio sicuro per riviste, cortometraggi indipendenti e autoprodotti, fuori dai circuiti.</description>
