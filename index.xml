      <description>The area of the Lutkemeer is not easy to find. You need to hop on tram 1, get off at the last stop, walk along the road, past industrial areas, until you reach a small cycle lane. Then you see them, the large fields referred to as the Lutkemeerpolder. These fields have been the battleground of a long dispute between grass-root organizations of farmers and citizens and the municipality of Amsterdam, which hopes to use the land to extent the adjacent Schipol airport.</description>

      <title>Lockdown creatives: Amsterdam’s Art in Times of Crisis</title>

      <description>In the past few months we have seen stuff we have never before and those drastic changes that Covid crisis brought with it has been difficult for many, such as Amsterdam’s artists who were forced to find new ways to create their art and gain inspiration.
 We can think back to the age of the bubonic plague, how it changed the lives of millions of people and it turned outbreaks into a recurring part of life.</description>

      <description>OT301 is a cultural hotspot in Amsterdam. Questioning its narrative as an autonomous space; we tried to engage with OT301’s history and the current state of affairs.
 Back in the ’80s, the lack of affordable housing helped the squatting movement to emerge in the Netherlands. ‘Squatting’ is what most would describe as occupying, living, in an abandoned building; not just out of necessity, but as a conscious political act.</description>

The coronavirus pandemic will bring an additional 130 million people to starvation, the UN warned in late April. Meanwhile, Europe and the United States are producing unprecedented amounts of food waste following the abrupt decline in demand from restaurants, catering services and school mensas. The message here is that the food system in the western world is ridiculously toxic and wasteful. While others starve, “over 1/3 of all food produced globally is thrown away and in countries like the US, 50% of the food produced is wasted,” explains Isabel Allen.</description>

 As the world slowly takes its first steps out of lockdown one aspect is becoming increasingly clear: we need to re-think our social interactions, the way we will manage our environment in the future, and above all the way we define human values. The current COVID-19 crisis might offer a unique perspective to learn from. The current debate seems to focus around how we can regain the status quo and return to our old lifestyle – “once all of this will be over“.</description>

      <description>At the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, a lockdown seemed extreme. Yet, over 100 countries implemented either a full or partial lockdown by the end of March. With the quarantine lasting weeks, people all over the world are forced to cope with a disruptive shift in their lifestyle. Working from home, the lack of social interaction, and the distressing uncertainty about the future. Besides these consequences, cases of domestic violence have surged.</description>

      <description>Wrapping your head around the biggest world crisis since WWII is not an easy task: there is so much uncertainty, there are so many questions, so much instability. Spring is finally creeping into the canals and the parks of Amsterdam but for this year we can forget the drinks and barbecues with friends, the ease and joy of the first days of warmth. Something as small and invisible as a virus has changed our life: what should we think about it?</description>

      <description>Numbers released by Statistics Netherlands revealed that, in 2018, the number of foreigners who registered at a Dutch municipality exceeded the number of people who left by 69.5 thousand. In 2018, between January and March, 186 thousand immigrants moved to the Netherlands; 4.5k more than during the same period in 2017. Amsterdam is known to be a truly liberal city, tolerant, welcoming and with a high quality of life, which is why the number of foreigners settling here is not likely to decrease anytime soon.</description>

      <description>Since I started ‘Cat Calls of Amsterdam’ I developed this sixth sense: every time someone is about to catcall me or my friend, or just a random stranger, a radar goes off in me“ says Ambrien Moenrialam, founder of the Instagram site ‘Cat Calls of Amsterdam’. Together with her team of three, she collects messages people send her of their cat calling experiences. They then visit the place where it happened and chalk the messages on the floor.</description>

      <description>When thinking about art and museums in Amsterdam, Museumsplein - located in the middle of the city center - is the first place that comes to mind. Or, for the more local sort, Jordaan and its variety of bohemian galleries offers a selection of fine art and sculptures. But rarely does Amsterdam South East, Zuid Oost, Watergrafsmeer blurring into Bijlmer blurring into Diemen, spring to mind.
 OSCAM, the Open Space Contemporary Art Museum, is trying to change this image.</description>

Wikimedia&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Author: W &amp;nbsp; CC BY 2.0 Lindsay Eyink&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Licence&amp;nbsp; --  Who would ever expect to find an anarchist bookshop in Jodenbreestraat Street, one of the most touristic spots of the capital? And yet there stands Fort of Sjakoo, one of the eldest stores of its kind, packed with shelves full of anarchist, feminist and left-wing political publications; the thoughts of some of the most important thinkers of history lay in ancient books, waiting to be read.</description>

 In 1972 -following an intense campaign from the Dutch feminist group Dolle Mina- the Netherlands declared contraception free for all. Yesterday, on Valentine, “the day of love”, Dutch women are experiencing a déjà vu: feminist legal firm Bureau Clara Wichmann and NGO De Goede Zaak handed over a subpoena demanding free contraception for all to the high council in Amsterdam.
 PanDam spoke to Femke Zeven, spokesperson for Bureau Clara Wichmann: “It was really nice to be at the High Council with all of the organizations and individuals that together are also supporting the case as a group.</description>

A few weeks before I had decided to open my own publication, to break my inertia and finally get started on a project I had been fantasizing about for years. I spent sleepless nights posting and posting in a multitude of writing-related Facebook groups, texting and emailing hundreds of people, hoping to find someone willing to embark on this project with me.</description>

      <description>Sunny is a sex worker in Amsterdam. You will sometimes find her at the Prostitution Information Center, sitting on Enge Kerksteeg 3, ready to answer all your questions over a steaming mint tea waiting to be served. The Center is very beautifully decorated, pictures and posters adorne its walls, and towards the back is a spacious wooden table. People often take pictures from outside, but when someone tried doing so during our interview Sunny rushed to the window and waved her arms in disapproval, “we don’t want people to just take pictures, we want them to come in for a chat”.</description>

      <description>My name is Fanny Tockner and I&amp;rsquo;m a PPE student at the VU from Berlin, Germany. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be part of the Pan-Dam team, because it is a grassroot magazine, where all decisions and contents are made from the bottom up and as a collective effort. It is a platform to creatively and more deeply engage with the city and share stories that ought to be heard - beyond tulips and canals.</description>

      <description>Pan-Dam is a multi-media online newspaper which aims at empowering the Youth of Amsterdam to participate in an innovative, sustainable development of the city, by cultivating a greater understanding of Amsterdam’s urban dynamics. We are here to talk about Amsterdam: its strengths, weaknesses, uniquenesses, contours, people. We want Amsterdam to thrive, become the best it can be. To allow for its blooming, Pan-Dam does two things: it provides an analysis of Amsterdam’s urban dynamics and empowers its readers by making them protagonists, through the use of narrative journalism.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Scintilla Benevolo, from Italy, and I study PPE at the VU. In September of 2019 I moved to New York for a five week internship, where I decided - once back in Amsterdam - to open a publication focusing on urban development. My stay in New York was a beautiful experience, I found its urban character to be fascinating, yet radically different from that of Amsterdam. With Pan-Dam we want to explore Amsterdam’s urban dynamics, expose its strengths and weaknesses, for the purpose of inspiring its readers to engage in fixing what is broken and building what is missing.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Tiana Japp and I moved to the Netherlands three years ago from Canada and the US. Currently, I am doing my bachelors at the Vrije Universiteit in Literature and Society. Through Pan-Dam, I hope to help bring attention to important topics within our city that need to be told. As an Indigenous woman living in Amsterdam, it can be difficult at times due to the lack of knowledge and representation found in the general consciousness.</description>
