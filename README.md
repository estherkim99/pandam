# pan-dam

Pan-Dam is a multi-media online newspaper which aims at empowering the Youth of Amsterdam to participate in an innovative, sustainable development of the city, by cultivating a greater understanding of Amsterdam’s urban dynamics. We are here to talk about Amsterdam: its strengths, weaknesses, uniquenesses, contours, people. We want Amsterdam to thrive, become the best it can be. To allow for its blooming, Pan-Dam does two things: it provides an analysis of Amsterdam’s urban dynamics and empowers its readers by making them protagonists, through the use of narrative journalism. Pan-Dam is a bottom-up newspaper, all of our content comes from talking to the fabric of the city: You. It is also You, we hope, who will make use of our stories to fix what is broken and build what is missing. Hence the name, ‘all’-Dam: involving all people, exposing all urban realities.
