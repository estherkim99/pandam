Hi, my name is Tiana Japp and I moved to the Netherlands three years ago from Canada and the US. Currently, I am doing my bachelors at the Vrije Universiteit in Literature and Society. Through Pan-Dam, I hope to help bring attention to important topics within our city that need to be told. As an Indigenous woman living in Amsterdam, it can be difficult at times due to the lack of knowledge and representation found in the general consciousness. Therefore, my passion lies in helping marginalized voices be heard. Through Pan-Dam, we hope to not only focus on the cultural happenings of Amsterdam, but the many social matters that need to be recognized. As this publication continues to evolve, we hope to grow into something that creates positive change from the ground up.
