My name is Fanny Tockner and I'm a PPE student at the VU from Berlin, Germany. I'm excited to be part of the Pan-Dam team, because it is a grassroot magazine, where all decisions and contents are made from the bottom up and as a collective effort. It is a platform to creatively and more deeply engage with the city and share stories that ought to be heard - beyond tulips and canals.
